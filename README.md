# PRG-Parser

Have you ever wanted to parse Commodore 64 *.prg files into readable BASIC? No, anyhow here is a python parser, which does exactly that. Just call it like this and be impressed by the beauty that is BASIC:
```basic
> ./PRGParser.py ./whyudothis.prg
1 REM ===================================
2 REM === well would you look at that ===
3 REM ===================================
10 POKE 1337, 42
...
```
